## Findings in the tutorials
In this section you can find what i have learned from the tutorial(What new things i have learned)

### HTTP
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
* Http is stateless, http only transfers text from one machine to another therefore it is stateless
* Http is build on top of TCP/IP and TCP/IP is not stateless
* TCP/IP is not stateless 
* Payload (body/data) can be anything as long as it is defined in the header(so in the header you can define what kind of text will be send, a html, javascript, img etc)  
### REST
What is rest? Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. 
Postman for example is a REST interface software to see the states of a application
* Use HTTP methods explicitly
* HTTP is usually the underlying protocol
* Caching Policy for responses (client can decide to keep it in their cache memory)
* Separtion of concerns between clients and servers
* Layerd System

### API
Application Programming Interface
* Defines Server-side functions that are supported
* Where requests should be made
* REST provides guidelines
* CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete)
